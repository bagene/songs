 [Verse 1]
**Here I am
Playin' with those memories again
And just when I thought time had set me free
Those thoughts of you keep taunting me
Holding you
A feeling I never outgrew
Though each and every part of me has tried
Only you can fill that space inside

 ... 
 [Verse 2]
So there's no sense pretending
My heart, it's not mending

 ... 
 [Chorus]
Just when I thought I was over you
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh, baby, those memories come crashin' through
And I just can't go on without you
On my own
I've tried to make the best of it alone
I've done everything I can to ease the pain
But only you can stop the rain

 ... 
[Verse 2]
I just can't live without you
I miss everything about you
Just when I thought I was over you

 ... 
[Verse 3]
And just when I thought I could stand on my own
Oh, baby, those memories come crashin' through
And I just can't go on without
Go on without

 ... 
[Verse 4]
It's just no good without
You (just when I thought I was over you)
Without you (just when I thought I could stand on my own)
Without you (just when I thought I was over you)
Without you (just when I thought I could stand on my own)
Without you (just when I thought I was over you)
Without you (just when I thought I could stand on my own)
Without you (just when I thought I was over you)**
