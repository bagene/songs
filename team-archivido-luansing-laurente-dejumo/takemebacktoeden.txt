Take Me Back To Eden
[Verse 1]
I dream in phosphorescence
Bleed through spaces
See you drifting past the fog
But no one told you where to go
We dive through crystal waters
Perfect oceans
But no one told me not to breathe
And now the weightlessness recedes
[Chorus]
My, my, those eyes like fire
I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre
Come now, bite through these wires
I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired
Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher
Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire
[Refrain]
I will travel far beyond the path of reason
Take me back to Eden
Take me back to Eden
Take me back to Eden
[Verse 2]
Well, yeah, I spit blood when I wake up
Sink porcelain stained, choking up brain matter and make-up
Just two days since the mainframe went down and I'm still messed up
Room feels like a meat freezer, I dangle in like cold cuts
Missed calls, answer phones from people I just don't trust
Mirror talk, fake love, but I'll take a pound of your flesh
Before you take a piece of my pay stub
White roses, black doves, Godmother, rise up
I need you to see me for what I have become
[Chorus]
My, my, those eyes like fire
I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre
Come now, bite through these wires
I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired
Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher
Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire
[Verse 3]
I guess it goes to show, does it not?
That we've no idea what we've got
Until we lose it
And no amount of love will keep it around
If we don't choose it
And I don't know what's got its teeth in me
But I'm about to bite back in anger
No amount of self-sought fury
Will bring back the glory of innocence
[Chorus]
My, my, those eyes like fire
I'm a winged insect, you're a funeral pyre
Come now, bite through these wires
I'm a waking hell and the gods grow tired
Reset my patient violence along both lines of a pathway higher
Grow back your sharpest teeth, you know my desire
[Post-Chorus]
When we were made
It was no accident
You know my desire
We were tangled up like branches in a flood
I have travelled far beyond the path of reason
Take me back to Eden
Take me back to Eden
