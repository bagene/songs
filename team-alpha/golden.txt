[Verse 1]
**I was a ghost, I was alone (hah)**
**어두워진 앞길 속에 (hah)**
**Given the throne, I didn't know how to believe**
**I was the queen that I'm meant to be**
**I lived two lives, tried to play both sides**
**But I couldn't find my own place**
**Called a problem child 'cause I got too wild**
**But now that's how I'm getting paid 끝없이 on stage**

[Chorus]
**I'm done hidin', now I'm shinin' like I'm born to be**
**We dreamin' hard, we came so far, now I'll believe**
