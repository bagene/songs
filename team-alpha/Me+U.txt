Me + U Lyrics

Team Alpha

[Intro]
**Yeah, you know I'm always by your side
So just listen, yeah**
Team Alpha

Team Alpha

[Verse 1]
**Babe, feels like only yesterday
Guess the memories never fade away
So many dreams we've been chasing together
We've been through the tears and the laughter
Now we've found a happy ever after
I got you, and that's all that matters
I'm so glad you're in my life**
Team Alpha

Team Alpha

[Chorus]
**No-one knows me
Like you do, honestly
Better than I know myself**
Team Alpha

All I need is you, just you
For everything we've been through
I'm grateful that you're my best friends until the end
I'll stick by your side like glue
It's true
Nothing's ever gonna come between us
Ain't no way we can't lose
Always me plus you**
Team Alpha

Team Alpha

[Verse 2]
**It still feels the same and though the seasons change
Through the ups and the downs, you stay my main
'Cause girl, one look in my eye and you read my mind
We got a connection that gets stronger every time
Ride or die

I won't take you for granted
A shoulder to cry on, I got it
So reach out your hand and I'll grab it
Day or night, I hold you down**
Team Alpha


Team Alpha

[Chorus]
**No-one knows me
Like you do, honestly
Better than I know myself

All I need is you, just you
For everything we've been through
I'm grateful that you're my best friends until the end
I'll stick by your side like glue
It's true
Nothing's ever gonna come between us
Ain't no way we can't lose
Always me plus you**
Team Alpha

Team Alpha

[Bridge]
**All I know, it just gets better with time
When you're feeling so down and lonely
I'll be there come rain or shine
Oh, if you don't already know
There's nothing that I won't do
It's always
Me plus you

Oh, yeah, yeah (Oh, yay, yeah)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, yeah
Ain't no thing, it's just me plus you**
Team Alpha

Team Alpha

[Chorus]
**All I need is you, just you
For everything we've been through
I'm grateful that you're my best friends until the end
I'll stick by your side like glue
It's true
Nothing's ever gonna come between us
Ain't no way we can't lose
Always me plus you

Oh, yeah
I gotta tell you
Always me plus you**
Team Alpha
